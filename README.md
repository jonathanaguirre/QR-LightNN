# QR-Code Based Lightweight Neural Network (ML) Project

This project is part of my hands-on learning journey through the LinkedIn Learning + Wolfram Research Machine Learning Certificate. It demonstrates that machine learning can be accomplished using minimal resources.

🎯 **Objective**  
Develop a lightweight neural network model for image classification using programmatically generated QR codes, where each QR code encodes a single numeric character (0–9) as a baseline for augmented images.

🚀 **For Beginners: How This Project Helps You**  
If you're new to ML, this repo shows you how to:
- Work in JupyterLab on a Chromebook or other low-powered device  
- Generate custom datasets with programmatically created QR codes  
- Design and train lightweight CNN models for image classification  
- Manage computational resources effectively in constrained environments  

🧠 **Model**  
- **Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** – *(Coming Soon!)*

🧰 **Tools & Technologies**  
- **JupyterLab** (web-based environment)  
- **Python 3**  
- NumPy, and OpenCV or Pillow for image processing

📊 **Dataset**  
- **Source:** Programmatically generated QR codes  
- **Features:** Numeric characters 0 through 9 encoded as separate QR images  
- **Target:** Corresponding character label  
- **Constraints:** Entire dataset size is kept under 25 MB for optimal efficiency

⚙️ **ML Workflow**  
**Part I: Data Generation & Preprocessing**  
- Programmatically generate QR codes with minimal file sizes  
- Resize and normalize images  
- Split data into training and validation sets

**Part II: Model Training** *(Coming Soon!)*  
- Design a lightweight CNN architecture tailored for QR code image classification  
- Train the model on the generated dataset

**Part III: Model Evaluation** *(Coming Soon!)* 
- Assess performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss  
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize results

- Explore modular QR code encoding
- Explore transfer learning for performance improvements  
- Add interactive demos via Binder for a one-click launch in a free cloud-based Jupyter environment

💬 **Final Note**  
This repository shows you don't need powerful hardware or paid services to dive into machine learning. If you have access to a browser, you have access to ML. Let’s build together and empower learners everywhere! ✊🏾💻🧠
