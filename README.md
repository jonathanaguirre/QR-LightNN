# QR-Code Based Lightweight Neural Network (ML) Project

This project is part of my hands-on learning journey demonstrating that machine learning can be accomplished using minimal resources—a Chromebook and free, open-source tools are all you need. No expensive hardware or cloud services required!

🎯 **Objective**  
Develop a lightweight neural network model for image classification using programmatically generated QR codes. Each QR code encodes a single alphanumeric character. The long-term vision is to build a secure messaging system based on modular QR code encoding.

🚀 **For Beginners: How This Project Helps You**  
If you're new to ML, this repo shows you:
- How to work in JupyterLab on a Chromebook or other low-powered device  
- How to generate custom datasets with programmatically created QR codes  
- How to design and train lightweight CNN models for image classification  
- How to manage computational resources effectively in constrained environments  
- How to build practical ML applications with entirely free tools

🧠 **Models Used**  
- **Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** – Optimized for fast training and minimal computational requirements on small QR code images

🧰 **Tools & Technologies**  
- **JupyterLab** (web-based environment)  
- **Python 3**  
- Libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch, NumPy, and OpenCV/Pillow for image processing

📊 **Dataset**  
- **Source:** Programmatically generated QR codes  
- **Features:** Each image encodes a single alphanumeric character  
- **Target:** The corresponding character label  
- **Constraints:** Entire dataset size is kept under 25 MB for optimal resource efficiency

⚙️ **ML Workflow**  
1. **Data Generation & Preprocessing**  
   - Programmatically generate QR codes with minimal file sizes  
   - Resize and normalize images as necessary  
   - Split data into training and validation sets

2. **Model Training**  
   - Design a lightweight CNN architecture tailored for QR code image classification  
   - Train the model on the generated dataset

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Assess performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss  
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize results

4. **Inference Example**  
   ```python
   # Example
   # Input: Image of a QR code encoding the character 'A'
   # Output: Predicted label 'A'
   ```
